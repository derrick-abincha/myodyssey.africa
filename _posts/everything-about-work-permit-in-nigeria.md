Obtaining a work permit in Nigeria involves navigating a multi-step process managed by the **Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS)** and the **Federal Ministry of Interior**. Here’s a clear breakdown:

## 1. Expatriate Quota Approval
Before hiring a foreign worker, your Nigerian entity must secure an **Expatriate Quota** from the Ministry of Interior. This sets the number of foreign staff allowed.

## 2. Temporary Work Permit (TWP)
For short-term assignments (up to 90 days), a TWP can be issued quickly—often within 48 hours—via the Ministry of Interior.

## 3. CERPAC (Combined Expatriate Residence Permit and Aliens Card)
For long-term roles, you’ll need a CERPAC, which combines:
- Residence permit
- Work authorization

### Required Documents:
- Valid passport
- Educational/professional credentials
- Medical report
- Police clearance
- Company registration documents
- Proof of tax compliance

## Processing Time
- Quota: 4–8 weeks
- CERPAC: 6–10 weeks

## Pro Tips
- Start early—delays are common during public holidays.
- Engage a local immigration partner to avoid document errors.
- Renewals should begin 60 days before expiry.
